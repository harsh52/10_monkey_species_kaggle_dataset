It was my Winter internship work to detect different type of monkey species on the kaggle dataset.

### My task inculded:
-------------------------------
1. Read several research paper and analyse different type of object detection algorithms eg. YOLO, fastRcnn, Rcnn etc.

2. Implement and analyse the result and compare with the research papers.

3. Analyse the matrix such and iou,mAP and loss.

4. Get insight of Deep Learning Concepts

5. familiarization with keras and other deep learning tools.

# Method and implentation
